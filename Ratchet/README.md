##Analysis

###Design (HTML + CSS)
Ratchet provides a set of HTML elements and classes in CSS to allow the realization of a set of elements with the iOS style and design.

###Control (JavaScript)
Ratchet does not have any language manipulation of the DOM. But provides different JS library:

  * push.js    - Is the engine that connects Ratchet pages together with AJAX and history api.
  * sliders.js - Is the engine that implements Ratchet pages slide.
  
To manage the DOM elements in the application is used [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).
