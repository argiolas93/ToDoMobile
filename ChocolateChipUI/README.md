##Analysis

###Design (HTML + CSS)
ChocolateChip UI provides a set of HTML elements with specific CSS classes to implement the style and design of different mobile OS.
Support iOS, Android and Windows Phone.

###Control (JavaScript)

  * ChocolateChip UI requires [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) 2.0.3 or later.

  * But ChcolateChip UI, have an other optional library, [ChocolateChipJS](http://chocolatechip-ui.com/documentation.html#/chocolatechipjs), which is    similar to jQuery, but it is not a drop in replacement.
It was built for mobile devices, not for desktop use. It's therefore small and fast, up to 30% faster than jQuery at doing typical DOM manipulations which you would do in an app.
**Note**: ChocolateChipJS is not a drop in replacement for jQuery. If you have plugins or libraries that depend on jQuery, stick with jQuery. If you do not have any such jQuery dependencies and performance is a big deal for you, please look into using to ChocolateChipJS.

  * ChocolateChip UI provides a number of ways for add events, depending on each mobile platform.
