##Analysis

###Design (HTML + CSS)
Ionic provides its own structure of HTML elements, the elements are all assigned a specific style and features based on precise angularJS library. It provides only iOS look and feel.

###Control (JavaScript)
Ionic requires AngularJS in order to work as its full potential. While you can still use the CSS portion of the framework, you'll miss out on powerful UI interactions, gestures, animations, and other things.

####AngularJS
AngularJS is a useful JavaScript framework to develop web application.
