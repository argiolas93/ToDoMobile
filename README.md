#ToDoMobile
Functional analysis of different framework for developing web applications on mobile devices.

##What is it?
Starting from [TodoMVC example](todomvc.com), I make a functional analysis of main framework for developing web applications on mobile devices.

The analysis look at JavaScript property used by each framework.
This is a detailed starting point, which help to select a framework for a particular application.

##Web Application
The application is a basic Todo with these functions:
  * Add todos in the list.
  * Remove a single todo from the list.
  * Select todos completed and delete all.
  * Save all todos. (By localStorage)
  
##Cordova/Phonegap
All the project are Apache Cordova based, it allow the developer to convert each web application in a mobile application.
All applications are developed with different frameworks and all the project have the android platform installed to test it on the device.
To use a Apache Cordova project is useful read the [documentation](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/).
